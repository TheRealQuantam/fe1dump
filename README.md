# fe1dump
Dumping Utility for Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light (NES)

## What It Is
First and foremost fe1dump is my testbed for things discovered during my reverse-engineering of Fire Emblem. It's quickly written code that tries to accomplish as much hypothesis verification as possible with as little time spent coding it.

A distant secondary purpose (and the reason I'm sharing it at all) is to serve as temporary documentation and reference implementation for others who might want to make Fire Emblem hacks and tools (especially one person), showing data locations and algorithms to decode that data.

## What It Is Not
Good code. The code is quick and dirty, poorly commented, not user-friendly, and not Pythonic. It's written primarily for my own use, and not written in a way that would make it maximally readable to others. If I had written it with a focus on others (or for it to be used as a module in other projects), I would have written it a lot differently.
